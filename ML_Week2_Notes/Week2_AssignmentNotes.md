#### Assignment Notes
-------------------------------

1. __logspace (a, b, n)__
    * from 10^a to 10^B, equal log space to get n points, such as: __(b-a)/n = interval, 1st= 10^a, 
    2nd = 10^(a+interval), 3rd = 10^(a+2*intervals) ...... nth = 10^b__                            
    * no specification of n, default is __50 points__
&nbsp;

2. __linspace (a, b, n)__
    * equal spaced from a to b gnerating n points
    * no n, default is __100 points__
&nbsp;

3. __a:interval:b__
    * from a to b with interval value
    * no specification of interval, default is 1
&nbsp;

4. __plot(x,y "rx" "Marksize", 10)__
    * properties follow corespponding x and y (red x with size 10 above)
    * hold on;hold off
    * plot (x,y, "-g;legend;")
    * plot (x, y, "or", x, y2, x, y3, "m", x, y4, "+")
&nbsp;

5. __surf(x,y,Z)__
    * x (i), y(j) but Z is matrix (j ,i), so pay attention to Z matrix if needs transpose
    * 3D plot
    * if no x and y, then Z col number is x and row number is y
&nbsp;

6. __Contour(x,y,Z,VN)__
    *plot coutour lines for 3D plot
    *VN is specified value cross-section cut at this value to form contour
    
7. __function__
    * write and store in .m file 
    * put into same folder where would refer this function or usingg addpath()function in "controltatements Notes.
    * 
    ```Octave
    function [a,b,c] = func(x,...) 
    % function outputs are a b c value and variables are x,..., [a b c] could be a string return this string value
    % refer function using filename (x,...), filename is name you store this function file.m
    end
    ```
